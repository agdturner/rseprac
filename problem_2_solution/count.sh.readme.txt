1. Backup your files to another directory just in case.
2. Download the script to the parent directory where your files are.
3. Open a terminal and change to the directory containing the files.
4. Run the script:
../count.sh 100
5. Check this has done what you want.

Any problems, please let me know (a.g.d.turner@leeds.ac.uk).

Thanks, Andy
