This is an exploratory 'query'.

Collating social media posts that are yet to happen is different to collating posts that happened in the past.

The 2019 Indian General Election was held in seven phases from April 11th to May 19th 2019.
The election result was declared on May 23rd.

Approximately how many individuals are in the group?
If you do not know exactly who is in the group, then what defines the group?
What time period is regarded as being 'in the run up' to the election?
These questions help to establish the scale of the data collection task and may provide useful information about how to narrow things down.

How do you plan to acquire the Twitter data?
Twitter can provide access to Tweet Data dating back to March 2006.
A 'full-archive search' is available to researchers approved for Twitter's Academic Research product.

Do you have a list of Twitter accounts that you are interested in?

How do you plan to acquire data from Facebook/Meta?
It is not clear if and how Facebook/Meta provides access to posts by individuals on the platform. 
What data is it that you think you can get from Facebook and what do you think the process is for acquiring it?
This will help establish how much the researcher knows about getting data from Facebook/Meta.

Does the researcher intend to apply for ethical approval from UREC for this research project?
Ethical approval is something that is probably needed...
